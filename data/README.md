To obtain the data for both MIPLIB 2010 and 2017, the download links can be found here:
  - MIPLIB 2010: http://miplib2010.zib.de/ -> all instance (tgz or zip)
  - MIPLIB 2017: https://miplib.zib.de/ -> collection.zip
  
Once these are downloaded the instances need to be decompressed to .mps files then can be placed in the appropriate  directories `miplib_2010/collection/` and `miplib_2017/collection/`.  Note that these files are quite large and will require around 107 GB of space when uncompressed.
